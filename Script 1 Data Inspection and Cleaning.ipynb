    "# Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: \n",
    "To determine the effects of a policy of “useacupuncture” on headache, health status, days off sick, and useof resources in patients with chronic headache compared with apolicy of “avoid acupuncture.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design: \n",
    "Randomised, controlled trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting:\n",
    "General practices in England and Wales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Participants: \n",
    "401 patients with chronic headache, predominantly migraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interventions: \n",
    "Patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over three months or to a control intervention offering usual care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main outcome measures:\n",
    "Headache score, SF-36 health status, and use of medication were assessed at baseline, three, and 12 months. Use of resources was assessed every three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "Headache score at 12 months, the primary end point,was lower in the acupuncture group (16.2, SD 13.7, n = 161,34% reduction from baseline) than in controls (22.3, SD 17.0,n = 140, 16% reduction from baseline). The adjusted difference between means is 4.6 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 7.0;P = 0.0002). This result is robust to sensitivity analysis incorporating imputation for missing data. Patients in the acupuncture group experienced the equivalent of 22 fewer days of headache per year (8 to 38). SF-36 data favoured acupuncture, although differences reached significance only forphysical role functioning, energy, and change in health. Compared with controls, patients randomised to acupuncture used 15% less medication (P = 0.02), made 25% fewer visits togeneral practitioners (P = 0.10), and took 15% fewer days offsick (P = 0.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "Acupuncture leads to persisting, clinically relevantbenefits for primary care patients with chronic headache, particularly migraine. Expansion of NHS acupuncture servicesshould be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributors: \n",
    "AJV conceived, designed and analysed the study and is itsguarantor; RWR, CEZ, CMS, and NE contributed to the original design with particular contributions to outcome assessment (RWR, CMS); patients andtreatment (CEZ); acupuncture treatment (NE). RM contributed to design of resource outcome assessment; RM, RvH and PF contributed to development of data collection methods for sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Funding: \n",
    "The trial (ISRCTN96537534) was funded by NHS R&D National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment (NCCHTA) grant: 96/40/15.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competing interests: \n",
    "NE provides acupuncture as part of her private physiotherapy practice."
